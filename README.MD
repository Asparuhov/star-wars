## Features

### Searching feature
When you enter the home page, right off the start, you will see a search bar, in which you can choose a category from all of the avaialble entities in the Star Wars universe and search them by their name, from the results you can dive deeply into the entity's relations tree.

### Entity page
Each entity will have their own page in which you can take a look, click on them, learn more about their being, add them to favorites, or why not check what relations they have.

### Image for every entity
Swapi.dev doesn't provide us with images from their entities, so what I did is align swapi's api with starwars-visualguide.com's CDN API, so I can give you images of EVERY SINGLE entity on the application, which makes the site feel more alive.

### Responsive design
All pages and views work on all types of devices, from the smallest to the biggest.

### Favorites
When you enter the detailed profile of some entity, you can press the heart icon to add them to your favorites, which will be saved the next time you enter the site, because it uses localStorage to persist your favorites.

### Galactic Trade Calculator 
One of the most intriguing features of the app is the Galactic Trade Exchanger, aptly named for its role in simulating interstellar currency exchange. It introduces fictional currencies, each subject to a dynamic market influenced by simulated demand and supply. What makes this feature particularly fascinating is its incorporation of a REAL TIME CHART. Every move that is made on the chosen currency, will be seen on the chat in real time.
